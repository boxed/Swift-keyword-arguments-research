Swift keyword arguments research
--------------------------------

This is a little project to find out how keyword arguments (or "labels") are
used in Swift. I'd like to find out how many times the name of the keyword
argument exactly matches the variable sent in, and maybe how often it
SHOULD match but a short acronym has been used instead.

Current results:
